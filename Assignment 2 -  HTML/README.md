# HTML Assignment 2

1. **Table Creation:**
    - Create an HTML table with at least 3 columns and 4 rows.
    - Utilize appropriate table elements such as **`<table>`**, **`<tr>`** (table row), **`<th>`** (table header), and **`<td>`** (table data) to structure your table.
    - Populate the table with meaningful data. For instance, you can create a table displaying information about different fruits, with columns representing Name, Color, and Taste.
2. **Unordered List (ul):**
    - Below the table, create an unordered list (ul) with at least 5 list items (li).
    - Each list item should contain a brief description or item of your choice. For example, you can list your favorite movies, books, or places to visit.
3. **Ordered List (ol):**
    - Following the unordered list, create an ordered list (ol) with at least 3 list items.
    - Use the ordered list to represent a step-by-step process or a ranking of items. This could be a list of steps for preparing a recipe or your top priorities for the week.
4. **Form Creation with Enhanced Validation:**
    - Design a simple HTML form that includes:
        - Text input for the user's name with a **`minlength`** of 3 and a **`maxlength`** of 50 characters.
        - Email input which is required and with placeholder.
        - Radio buttons for gender selection (Male/Female/Other).
        - A drop-down menu (select element) for age range (e.g., 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, etc.).
        - A checkbox for opting into a newsletter.
        - A submit button to submit the form.
5. **Validation:**
    - Implement basic form validation. Ensure that the name field meets the specified **`minlength`** and **`maxlength`** criteria. Additionally, validate that at least one gender option is selected. You can achieve this using the **`required`**, **`minlength`**, **`maxlength`**, and other relevant attributes.
