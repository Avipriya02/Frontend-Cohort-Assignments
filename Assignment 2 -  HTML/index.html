        <h2>My Top Five Favourite Places</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Darjeeling: Darjeeling is a renowned hill station and a popular tea-producing region located in the
                eastern part of India, in the state of West Bengal. Nestled in the Himalayas, it is famous for its
                scenic beauty, with stunning views of snow-capped peaks, lush tea gardens, and mist-covered valleys.
            </li>
            <li>Sikkim: Sikkim is a small but stunningly beautiful state located in the northeastern part of India,
                nestled between Nepal, Bhutan, and Tibet (China). It is one of the least populous states in India but is
                rich in natural beauty, culture, and biodiversity. Sikkim is renowned for its spectacular landscapes,
                which include snow-capped mountains, alpine meadows, lush forests, and rushing rivers.</li>
            <li>Dooars: Dooars refers to a picturesque region in the northeastern part of India, located primarily in
                the state of West Bengal, with parts extending into Assam. The term "Dooars" (or Duars) is derived from
                the word "door", referring to the "gateway" between the plains of Bengal and the foothills of the
                Himalayas. This region serves as a passageway to the foothills and is known for its rich biodiversity,
                tea gardens, forests, and ethnic diversity.</li>
            <li>Shillong: Shillong is the capital city of the northeastern Indian state of Meghalaya, often referred to
                as the "Scotland of the East" due to its stunning natural beauty, cool climate, and lush green
                landscapes. Located in the Khasi Hills at an altitude of around 1,500 meters (4,900 feet) above sea
                level, Shillong is famous for its scenic views, waterfalls, and vibrant culture.</li>
            <li>Ladakh: Ladakh is a breathtaking region located in the northernmost part of India, known for its stark,
                high-altitude landscapes, ancient Buddhist monasteries, and vibrant cultural heritage. Situated in the
                Himalayas and the Trans-Himalayan ranges, Ladakh was historically a crossroads for trade between India,
                Tibet, and Central Asia, and it remains a culturally rich and isolated region. It is now a union
                territory of India, formed after the reorganization of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019.</li>

        <h2>Chicken Butter Masala</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Marinate the chicken
                <ol>
                    <li>In a bowl, combine the chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder,
                        turmeric
                        powder, garam masala, lemon juice, and salt. Mix everything well until the chicken is evenly
                        coated.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cover and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes to an hour (for best results, marinate it for
                        2–3
                        hours, or even overnight in the fridge).</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook the chicken
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan or skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the marinated
                        chicken pieces in batches, so as not to overcrowd the pan.</li>
                    <li>Cook the chicken for 4-5 minutes on each side, until browned and cooked through. The chicken
                        should
                        be tender but not overcooked. Set aside.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare the gravy
                <ol>
                    <li>In the same pan, add 2 tablespoons of butter and a tablespoon of oil. Once the butter has
                        melted,
                        add the whole spices: cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, cloves, and bay leaf. Sauté for about 30
                        seconds until fragrant.</li>
                    <li>Add the finely chopped onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5–7 minutes until golden
                        brown.</li>
                    <li>Add the ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another 1–2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the pureed tomatoes and cook for 8–10 minutes, until the oil begins to separate from the
                        tomato mixture.</li>
                    <li>Add the red chili powder, garam masala, and salt. Cook for another minute, allowing the spices
                        to
                        blend into the sauce.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine the chicken with the gravy
                <ol>
                    <li>Add the cooked chicken pieces into the gravy. Stir well to coat the chicken in the sauce.</li>
                    <li>Add about 1/4 cup of water (or more for your desired consistency). Simmer the curry on low heat
                        for
                        5–7 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the heavy cream and kasuri methi (crushed between your palms), and cook for another 2-3
                        minutes until the gravy is smooth and creamy.</li>
                    <li>Taste the curry and adjust the seasoning, adding sugar if you find the sauce too tangy from the
                        tomatoes.</li>
                    <li></li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                Garnish and serve
                <ol>
                    <li>Once the chicken is cooked and the gravy is creamy, turn off the heat.</li>
                    <li>Garnish with freshly chopped coriander leaves and a dollop of butter if desired.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
