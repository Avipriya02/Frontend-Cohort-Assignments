Objective:

Create a card-based web application using HTML and CSS. Each card should have its own dedicated HTML file for modularity and better maintainability.


Main File (index.html):

    Create a main landing page named index.html.
    The page should act as a directory linking to three different cards.
    The links on the main page should be labeled as "Card 1," "Card 2," and "Card 3."


Card Files (card1.html, card2.html, card3.html):

    Create separate HTML files: card1.html, card2.html, and card3.html.
    Each file should contain one card designed with HTML and CSS.
