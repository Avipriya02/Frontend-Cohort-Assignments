        <p class="blog-content">Mental health refers to a person’s emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It
            affects how individuals think, feel, and behave in daily life, influencing how they handle stress, relate to
            others, and make decisions. Good mental health doesn’t mean an absence of mental illness but rather the
            ability to function well, cope with challenges, and maintain a sense of balance.</p>
        <p class="blog-content">Key Aspects of Mental Health

            Emotional Well-Being
            Emotional health involves recognizing and managing feelings, whether positive or negative. It includes
            developing resilience, the ability to bounce back from setbacks, and maintaining a sense of optimism.

            Psychological Well-Being
            This aspect relates to a person’s ability to process thoughts, manage stress, and solve problems.
            Psychological health is closely tied to cognitive functions like memory, decision-making, and learning.

            Social Well-Being
            Healthy relationships and social connections are vital for mental health. Being part of a supportive
            community or maintaining meaningful relationships helps foster a sense of belonging.

        <p class="blog-content">Positive Impacts

            Connection and Support
            Social media allows individuals to connect with others, share experiences, and find communities with shared
            interests or challenges.

            Access to Information
            It provides a platform for learning about mental health, accessing resources, and finding inspiration for
            self-care and wellness.

            Empowerment and Advocacy
            Social media is a tool for raising awareness and breaking the stigma around mental health by sharing stories
            and supporting advocacy campaigns.

            Creative Expression
            Platforms encourage users to express themselves through writing, photography, art, and videos, which can be
            therapeutic.</p>

            Negative Impacts

            Comparison and Low Self-Esteem
            Exposure to curated, idealized versions of others’ lives can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low
            self-worth.

            Addiction and Time Drain
            Excessive use of social media can lead to dependency, reduced productivity, and neglect of real-world
            interactions.

            Cyberbullying
            Negative interactions, such as bullying or harassment, can significantly harm mental health.

            Overloading the Brain
            The constant flow of information and notifications can overwhelm users, causing stress and anxiety.
